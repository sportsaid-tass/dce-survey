                    The Talented Athlete Scholarship Programme (TASS) are completing in partnership with Northumbria
                    University to improve athlete well-being and support through the development of a new TASS app.
                    We are looking for TASS athletes and practitioners to provide feedback on what this app may look
                    like and extends our preliminary qualitative research.

                <p class="font-regular">
                    In order to understand better your preferences for such an app we have assembled an online
                    survey instrument. This is made up of the core characteristics and features of the app. By
                    completing this survey we will get a clearer understanding of what the app would look like.
                    Findings from this research will also directly inform the construction of the app over the next
                    year. This survey will take approximately 8 to 10 minutes to complete. If you experience any
                    technical difficulties, please contact Paras at <a

                <p class="font-regular">
                    In Section One the individual scenarios ask you to consider two different apps; App A or App B.
                    You will be asked to indicate which app you prefer by considering the features that make up each
                    app. If you feel that you would not choose either App A or App B then feel free to tick Neither.
                    Finally please make sure you only tick one box.

                <p class="font-regular">
                    Imagine a situation in which you are using an app in conjunction with TASS. After some time
                    thinking about what features you would like to use, you have narrowed your choice down to two
                    options: App A and App B. Each of the apps contains different decision making factors and a
                    predetermined set of features. Please consider the following scenarios and select which app you
                    would prefer to choose. No answers are considered right or wrong.
